      "q3": "Can I switch between camera and screen sessions?",
      "a3": "Yes. Your hours work across all session types. Use camera-based focus tracking, screen monitoring, or both at the same time - it all draws from the same balance.",
      "q4": "What happens when I run out of hours?",

        "question": "Does BrainDock violate my privacy?",
        "answer": "No, privacy was a top priority when we built BrainDock. We don't permanently store anything, we don't use facial recognition, and your session data stays on your device. BrainDock is here to help you focus, not collect your personal information."
      },
      "screenSharing": {
        "question": "Is sharing your screen private and safe?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely. Screen sharing is done entirely on your computer and works offline. BrainDock only reads the name of your active window to check against your distraction list. No screenshots are taken, no recordings are made, and nothing regarding this leaves your machine."
      },
      "whatCanNotice": {
        "question": "What can BrainDock actually notice during your session?",
        "answer": "BrainDock can notice activities during your session. For example, stepping away from your desk, distractions like using your phone, tablets, game controllers, etc. The best part is that it only flags these when you're actually using them in front of your screen, not just because they're nearby."
      },
      "internetConnection": {
        "question": "Does BrainDock require an internet connection?",
        "answer": "Screen sharing operates entirely offline, as it runs locally on your computer. AI-powered distraction sensing requires an internet connection to identify devices such as phones and tablets; however, no data is stored permanently on servers, and any data sent for analysis is discarded after processing."
      },
      "cloudData": {
        "question": "Is my data uploaded to the Cloud?",
        "answer": "Your session statistics, reports, and personal data remain on your computer. For distraction sensing, frames are temporarily transmitted to our AI models for analysis and then deleted. No data is stored permanently, and we do not retain records of your sessions."
